        <p>
            Thank you for one hundred and twenty days of love, laughter, and memories — for the countless moments you’ve made me feel special and for being the love of my life, baba. Happy fourth monthsary! Four beautiful months of being yours and seven wonderful months of building this love together — and every day, my heart feels even more grateful for you, baba. You are my greatest blessing, my safe place, my home, and my everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am so incredibly proud of you, my love. Congratulations on passing your CHRA exam! I always knew you could do it — with your dedication, brilliance, and passion. But beyond your achievements, it’s the person you are that amazes me the most, baba. You are kind, brave, strong, hardworking, and full of so much love. You inspire me in more ways than I can ever express, and I am always here to support you, love you, and stand beside you as you reach for your dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s been fourteen days since we last saw each other. I know being apart isn’t easy. Even when distance keeps us away, please know that my love for you remains constant. I miss you more than words can say, baba. But no distance can ever change the love I feel for you. Every day that passes brings us closer to the life we’re building — a life where we won’t have to say goodbye, where we’ll come home to each other every day, and where love will fill every corner of the home we’ll share.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baba, thank you for loving me the way you do — with so much patience, care, and understanding. You make me feel safe, seen, and deeply cherished, and that’s a gift I’ll never take for granted. You are my peace, my happiness, and the greatest love I’ve ever known. You are the best, baba. No matter where life takes us, please know this: I will always choose you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s to two hundred and twelve days of laughter, love, and memories — and to a lifetime more. You are my heart, my happiness, and my forever, baba. Take care of yourself, my love. I love you more than words could ever express.
        </p>
        <p>
            Always and forever yours,<br>
            With all the love I have,<br>
            Kim Jerald G. Dimasangal
